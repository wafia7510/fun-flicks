## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

I have also used Mermaid flowchart to generate my flowchart.

```mermaid

    B --> C(Get random questions)
    C --> D(Prompt user for input options)
    D --> E{Is input valid?}
    E -- Yes --> F{Are there more questions?}
    E -- No --> D
    F -- Yes --> G(Is answer correct?)
    G -- Yes --> H(Increment score)
    G -- No --> I(Increment wrong answer)
    F -- No --> J(Display score)

### Functions


The primary functions used on this application are:

- `playGame()`
    - This function starts the game and handles the main gameplay loop. It randomly selects questions, displays them, collects user input, and checks if the input is correct.
- `get_random_question()`
    - This function retrieves a random question that hasn’t been asked yet in the current game session..
- `get_validated_input()`
    - This function handles the user input and ensures that it’s a valid option (A, B, C, or D). It continues prompting the user until a valid input is provided.
- `validate_input()`
    - This function checks if the user’s input matches the correct answer for the current question.
- `clear()`
    - Clears the terminal screen to keep the game interface clean and readable.
- `reset_game()`
    -  Resets the game’s state (like score, wrong answers, and asked questions) to allow the player to play a new game.
- `displayScore()`
    -  Displays the final score and the number of wrong answers at the end of the game.
- `main()`
    - This is the entry point for the entire program. It sets up the game by providing instructions and calling the playGame() function.


### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `from questions import questions`:  The questions object (a list of dictionaries) contains all the quiz questions, options, and correct answers. It serves as the main data source for a game, and it's used extensively in functions like playGame() and get_random_question().
- `time`: The time. sleep(1) function is used in validate_input() to pause for one second after displaying whether the answer was correct or not, giving the player time to read the feedback before the screen is cleared.
- `os`: The os.system() function in the clear() function clears the terminal screen. Depending on the operating system (nt for Windows, otherwise for Unix-like systems), it runs the appropriate command to clear the screen, making the game interface cleaner.
- `colorama`: colorama.Fore, colorama.Back, and colorama.Style are used to colorize messages. For example, correct answers are displayed in green (Fore.GREEN), wrong answers in red (Fore.RED), and score-related messages use combinations like blue text on a white background (Fore.BLUE + Back.WHITE).
- `random`: The random.randrange() function is used in get_random_question() to randomly select an index from the list of questions, ensuring that each question is chosen unpredictably.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://fun-flicks-3ac6ed0650bd.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.



#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wafia7510/fun-flicks) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/wafia7510/fun-flicks.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wafia7510/fun-flicks)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wafia7510/fun-flicks)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

#### Local Development:

- The project runs on  local machine using Python. Local deployment gives full control, making it easy to test, debug, and modify code quickly.
- Dependencies are installed via requirements.txt, and the app is run directly with a command like python app.py.
- Ideal for quick iterations and testing.

#### Deployment (Heroku):
- The app runs in a cloud environment, accessible via a public URL.
- Requires a Procfile to specify how Heroku should run the app.
- Dependencies are automatically installed by Heroku from requirements.txt.
- Ideal for making the app available to a wider audience.
